## IT Agent

### 2026-02-16
**Mistake**: PR creation failed with "could not determine repo" error.
**Fix**: Always run `gh repo set-default OWNER/REPO` before creating PRs. The setup wizard now does this automatically after fork-clone, but verify with `gh repo set-default --view`.

### 2026-02-16
**Mistake**: Fork didn't have the template branch, causing clone to fail.
**Fix**: Use 3-strategy approach: direct clone → sync fork + retry → clone original + fix remotes.

### 2026-03-08
**Mistake**: Used `npm --prefix` with a relative path and npm resolved to a duplicated path, causing ENOENT for package.json.
**Fix**: Run `npm install` from the module root with `cd` to ensure correct workspace resolution.

### 2026-03-08
**Mistake**: Terminal got stuck in a dangling quote after a command, causing `dquote>` prompts and blocking subsequent commands.
**Fix**: Use a fresh background terminal session for the next command (or close the quote with a standalone `"`), then continue in the clean session.

## Product Owner

### 2026-03-08
**Mistake**: Attempted to push agent branch without an upstream tracking branch.
**Fix**: Push with `git push --set-upstream origin <branch>` to set the upstream.
